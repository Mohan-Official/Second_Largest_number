//Algorithm for Second Largest Number....

Step_1:
    Initialize two variables, Maximum and Second_Maximum.
Step_2:
    Initialize the Second_Maximum to the smallest possible value.
Step_3:
    Compare the each element to Maximum and Second_Maximum, by using Loop.
Step_4:
    If the current element is greater than Maximum, then set the Second_Maximum as Maximum and Maximum as the current element.
Step_5:
    If the current element is between Maximum and Second_Maximum, then set Second_Maximum to the current element.
Step_6:
    After the loop, the second largest number will be stored in the Second_Maximum variable.
