//Algorithm for Second Largest Number....
Step_1:
Initialize two variables, max and secondMax, to the smallest possible value.
Step_2:
Loop through the array, comparing each element to max and secondMax.
Step_3:
If the current element is greater than max, set secondMax to max and max to the current element.
Step_4:
If the current element is between max and secondMax, set secondMax to the current element.
Step_5:
After the loop, the second largest number will be stored in the secondMax variable.
